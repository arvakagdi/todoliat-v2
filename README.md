# todolist-v2

Created a todo list website - [todolist](https://pure-ocean-24769.herokuapp.com/)
Includes fucntionality of deleting and adding items. We can also create multiple lists. 

Express.js is used for the back-end, together with MongoDB database software to store data from all the lists. HTML and CSS is used for the front-end
